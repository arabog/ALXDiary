/*
-: Prototypal Inheritance: Subclasses
Subclasses
One of the benefits of implementing inheritance is that it 
allows you to reuse existing code. By establishing inheritance, 
we can subclass, that is, have a "child" object take on most or 
all of a "parent" object's properties while retaining unique 
properties of its own.
