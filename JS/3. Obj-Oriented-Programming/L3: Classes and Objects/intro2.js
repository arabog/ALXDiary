/*
-: Setting Our Own `this`
Whether you're invoking a constructor function with 
the new operator, invoking a method on an object, or 
simply invoking a function normally -- each form of 
invocation sets the value of this a bit differently.

But what if we want to set the value of this ourselves? 
JavaScript offers a few methods that can do just that!
