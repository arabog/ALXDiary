/*
-: Scope:
If you took Intro to Javascript, you learned about block scope vs. 
function scope. These determine where a variable can be seen in 
some code. Computer scientists call this lexical scope.

However, there also exists another kind of scope called runtime 
scope. When a function is run, it creates a new runtime scope. 
This scope represents the context of the function, or more 
specifically, the set of variables available for the function to use.

So what exactly does a function have access to?

Scope
A function's runtime scope describes the variables available for 
use inside a given function. The code inside a function has 
access to:

The function's arguments.
Local variables declared within the function.
Variables from its parent function's scope.
Global variables.
