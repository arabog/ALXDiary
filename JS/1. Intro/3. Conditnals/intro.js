We Write Code to Solve Problems
When you write code, you break down problems into steps that are 
executed by a computer. These steps are known as an algorithm.

Example: Purchase Algorithm

Think about the steps you need to take to decide whether to 
purchase an item.

Do I want the item?
Do I have enough money to purchase the item?
If the answer to both questions is yes, you will purchase the item. 
The process you went through to solve that problem, and the steps 
you took in order to do so, is at the heart of writing code.


Solving the Problem: Do I purchase the hammer?
To answer that question we need to know:

How much money do I have?
How much does the hammer cost?


if (/* this expression is true ) {
          // run this code
} else {
          // run this code
}
