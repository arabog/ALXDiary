/*
The numbering of the array order starts at 0 -- not at 1

You can even store an array in an array to create a nested array!

// creates a `arraysInArrays` array with three arrays
const arraysInArrays = [
          [1, 2, 3], 
          ["Julia", "James"], 
          [true, false, true, false]
];

-: Accessing Array Elements
Elements and Indexes
An element is an individual piece of data in an array.
Each element in the array is numbered, starting with 0. This number is called the index.
The index allows us to access the element's position in the array.
