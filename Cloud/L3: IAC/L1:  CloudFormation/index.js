-: What is (Cloud) Infrastructure?
Cloud services are broadly categorized as Software as a Service (SaaS), 
Platform as a Service (PaaS), or Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Cloud 
is a collection of geographically distributed data centers that are logically 
grouped into regions and availability-zones.

The IaaS allows a user to provision Virtual Machines (VMs), set up networks 
(VPC), create subnets, and associate necessary security features. Further, 
VMs can be attached to storage volumes, different networks, or servers. 
All the resources mentioned above are referred to as Infrastructure.

-: Lesson Objectives
After completing this lesson, you will be able to...
Describe Infrastructure as a Code (IaaC) as one of the best practices 
used in the DevOps model.

Configure basic settings to start using AWS services as an Identity and 
Access Management (IAM) user.

Explain the fundamentals of Cloud Formation.

Contrast the manual vs. automated (script-based) provisioning of 
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

Utilize the AWS command-line tool - CLI for necessary activities, such 
as configuring a VPC, or creating an IAM user.

-: What is DevOps
DevOps = Development + Operatns

Operatnal is d part of IT dt mnages, monitors, configures, and deploys software
