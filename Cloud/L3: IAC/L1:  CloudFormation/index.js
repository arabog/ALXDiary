What is (Cloud) Infrastructure?
Cloud services are broadly categorized as Software as a Service (SaaS), 
Platform as a Service (PaaS), or Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Cloud 
is a collection of geographically distributed data centers that are logically 
grouped into regions and availability-zones.

The IaaS allows a user to provision Virtual Machines (VMs), set up networks 
(VPC), create subnets, and associate necessary security features. Further, 
VMs can be attached to storage volumes, different networks, or servers. 
All the resources mentioned above are referred to as Infrastructure.
