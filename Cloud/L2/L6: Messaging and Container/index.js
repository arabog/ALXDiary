Messaging in the Cloud
There are often times that users of your applications need to be 
notified when certain events happen. Notifications, such as text 
messages or emails can be sent through services in the cloud. 
The use of the cloud offers benefits like lowered costs, increased 
storage, and flexibility.

Q: Messages are typically sent between which two entities?
Messaging typically occurs between Internet-based 
applications and devices. One system can send a message 
to another system.
