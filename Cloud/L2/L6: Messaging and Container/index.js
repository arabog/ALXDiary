Messaging in the Cloud
There are often times that users of your applications need to be 
notified when certain events happen. Notifications, such as text 
messages or emails can be sent through services in the cloud. 
The use of the cloud offers benefits like lowered costs, increased 
storage, and flexibility.

Q: Messages are typically sent between which two entities?
Messaging typically occurs between Internet-based 
applications and devices. One system can send a message 
to another system.


Simple Notification Service
Amazon Simple Notification Service (or SNS) is a cloud service 
that allows you to send notifications to the users of your applications. 
SNS allows you to decouple the notification logic from being 
embedded in your applications and allows notifications to be 
published to a large number of subscribers(wc can be a person 
or anoda AWS service).

Features
SNS uses a publish/subscribe model.
SNS can publish messages to Amazon SQS queues, AWS Lambda 
functions, and HTTP/S webhooks.

Tips
SNS is found under the Application Integration section on the 
AWS Management Console.
SNS Topic names are limited to 256 characters.
A notification can contain only one message.

Q: Which ways can notifications be sent to users via SNS? Pick three.
Notifications can be sent to end users using mobile push, text 
messages, and email.
