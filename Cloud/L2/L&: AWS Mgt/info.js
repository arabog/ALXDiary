Why do we need logging and auditing in the cloud?

-: Logging In The Cloud
Logging provides visibility into your cloud resources and applications. 
For applications that run in the cloud, you will need access to logging 
and auditing services to help you proactively monitor your resources 
and applications.

Logging allows you to answer important questions like:
How is this server performing?
What is the current load on the server?
What is the root cause of an application error that a user is seeing?
What is the path that leads to this error?

-: Cloud Trail
Cloud Trail allows you to audit (or review) everything that occurs in 
your AWS account. Cloud Trail does this by recording all the AWS API 
calls occurring in your account and delivering a log file to you.

Features
CloudTrail provides event history of your AWS account activity, including:
who has logged in
services that were accessed
actions performed
parameters for the actions
responses returned
This includes actions taken through the AWS Management Console, 
AWS Software Development Kits(SDKs), command line tools, and 
other AWS services.

Tips
Cloud Trail is found under the Management & Governance section 
on the AWS Management Console.
CloudTrail shows results for the last 90 days.
You can create up to five trails in an AWS region.

Q: Identify features provided by Cloud Trail. Pick three.
Set up alerts and alarms for certain activities
Log responses from AWS services
Track calls made using the SDK

Cloud Trail allows you to audit (or review) everything that occurs 
in your AWS account.
