Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines

Project 1 - Deploy Static Website on AWS
In this project, you will deploy a static website to AWS. 
First, you will create an S3 bucket, 
configure the bucket for website hosting, and 
secure it using IAM policies. 

Next, you will upload the website files to your bucket and 
speed up content delivery using AWS’s content distribution 
network service, CloudFront. 

Lastly, you will access your website in a browser using 
the unique S3 endpoint.


Project 2 - Deploy a high-availability web app using CloudFormation
In this project, you’ll deploy web servers for a highly available web app 
using CloudFormation. You will write the code that creates and deploys 
the infrastructure and application for an Instagram-like app from the 
ground up. You will begin with deploying the networking components 
followed by servers, security roles and software. 


Project 3 - Build CI/CD Pipelines, Monitoring & Logging
In this course, you’ll learn the process of taking software from source 
code to deployment and beyond. You’ll learn about automated testing, 
choosing the right deployment strategy for your business needs and 
deploying an appropriate CI/CD pipeline. You’ll also learn about 
monitoring and logging to ensure that your application is running at 
peak performance and stays that way.

You’ll also learn to manage and make changes to your servers in 
an automated way, using Ansible, a leading Configuration 
Management tool.


Project 4 - Operationalize a Machine Learning Microservice API
In this project, you will continue your work on operationalizing 
microservices by deploying an elastic and fault-tolerant Machine 
Learning inference API using Kubernetes. 

You will validate your design by load testing the service and 
verifying the application architecture performs as designed.


Project 5 - Capstone Project
In the capstone project, each project is unique to the student. 
You’ll build a CI/CD pipeline for a microservices application 
for different deployment strategies. Students define the scope 
of the project and select the right deployment strategy based 
on different business requirements.
