-: Introduction to Continuous Delivery
There is some confusion in the community around Continuous Delivery, Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. For the sake of 
consistency throughout this course, we will assume that Continuous Delivery is an overarching paradigm or mindset that informs and enhances the practices of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.

Continuous Delivery = Continuous Integration + Continuous Deployment

Continuous Integration: 
The practice of mergining all developer's working copies to a shared mainline
several times a day.

Continuous Deployment:
A software engineering approach in wc d value is delivered freqly via 
automated deploymts

Continuous Delivery:
An engineering practice in wc teams produce and release value in 
short cycles
