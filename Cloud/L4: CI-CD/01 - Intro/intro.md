-: Introduction to Continuous Delivery
There is some confusion in the community around Continuous Delivery, Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. For the sake of 
consistency throughout this course, we will assume that Continuous Delivery is an overarching paradigm or mindset that informs and enhances the practices of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.

Continuous Delivery = Continuous Integration + Continuous Deployment

Continuous Integration: 
The practice of mergining all developer's working copies to a shared mainline
several times a day.

Continuous Deployment:
A software engineering approach in wc d value is delivered freqly via 
automated deploymts

Continuous Delivery:
An engineering practice in wc teams produce and release value in 
short cycles

CI/CD is a set of development practices aimed at automating the building, testing, and deployment of applications.

-: Continuous Delivery Is Important
Devops, Agile, Lean, Kanban, Scrum... all great things, all exciting buzz words, each the subject of many conferences, blogs and courses. But, not a single one of those amazing concepts or methodologies will make a real difference until we allow them to change how we think about the value we deliver to our customers.

Continuous Delivery doesn't replace anything, but rather it enhances everything.

-: Stakeholders
Both sides of the business/tech divide need to involve the other side in decisions so that our companies can be stronger and make a better impact on the world. But, since you're the one taking this course, it's probably going to be up to you to start the conversation. You can start by bringing your business leaders into the discussion about CI/CD and Continuous Delivery.

Use this as an opportunity to translate the technical terms into words that matter to the business-minded people in your company. Convince them to move in the direction of Continuous Delivery based on the very real benefits it can have for your company, not just some cool technical features that make developers happy. By bringing the business side of the house into the discussion, you'll be better positioned to make real change!

Always remember that business leaders need to be at the helm of decisions that affect the bottom-line.
