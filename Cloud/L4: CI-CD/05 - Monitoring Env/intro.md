What Does Monitoring Feel Like?
Let's face it, monitoring is not that exciting! When you became an engineer, you probably didn't say "I can't wait to monitor stuff!". For many, it's like the matrix; there's so much information, it's like lines just blurring together! For others, it's not enough useful data. Plus, it's hard to get excited about something that seems to only brings bad news.

What's the Reality?
It's a necessary evil!
Raise issues quickly and loudly.
Best weapon against down-time.
Often the most neglected or underestimated tool.
What are the Possibilities?
In the heat of battle, you'll get to problems faster.
Find out when something goes down or degrades (network logs).
Wake up the right people in an event (app logs).
Find out an hour before an outage (CPU, memory, disk).
Use data to predict the next outage in 2 weeks (ML, data science).
