In this lesson, requests are typically HTTP requests with some input data, and a response will be a JSON-formatted set of output values.

What is AWS Lambda?
From the AWS documentation:

"AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers."

"AWS Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second.
You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running."
"You can use AWS Lambda to run your code in response to events," such as HTTP requests.

SQS Queue
Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a secure, durable, and available hosted queue that lets you integrate and decouple distributed software systems and components.

A queue is just a type of list that orders data in a particular way; typically in a first-item-in = first-item-out order (FIFO)
