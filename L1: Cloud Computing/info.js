Cloud Computing
Cloud Computing is the delivery of IT resources over the Internet. 

It allows you to manage: (Databases, Compute Power, Application, Security)
Storage services like databases
Servers, compute power, networking
Analytics, artificial intelligence, augmented reality
Security services for data and applications


Characteristics of Cloud Computing
Pay as you go - You pay only for what you use and only when your code runs.
Autoscaling - The number of active servers can grow or shrink based on demand.
Serverless - Allows you to write and deploy code without having to worry 
about the underlying infrastructure.


Types of Cloud Computing:
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS): The provider supplies virtual server 
instances, storage, and mechanisms for you to manage servers.
An IaaS provides underlying infrastructure

Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS): A platform of development tools hosted 
on a provider's infrastructure.
PaaS is a platform of both hardware and software tools such as operating 
systems and database management and development tools.


Software-as-a-Service (SaaS): A software application that runs over the 
Internet and is managed by the service provider.
