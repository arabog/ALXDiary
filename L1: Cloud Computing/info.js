Cloud Computing
Cloud Computing is the delivery of IT resources over the Internet. 

It allows you to manage: (Databases, Compute Power, Application, Security)
Storage services like databases
Servers, compute power, networking
Analytics, artificial intelligence, augmented reality
Security services for data and applications


Characteristics of Cloud Computing
Pay as you go - You pay only for what you use and only when your code runs.
Autoscaling - The number of active servers can grow or shrink based on demand.
Serverless - Allows you to write and deploy code without having to worry 
about the underlying infrastructure.


Types of Cloud Computing:
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS): The provider supplies virtual server 
instances, storage, and mechanisms for you to manage servers.
An IaaS provides underlying infrastructure

Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS): A platform of development tools hosted 
on a provider's infrastructure.
PaaS is a platform of both hardware and software tools such as operating 
systems and database management and development tools.


Software-as-a-Service (SaaS): A software application that runs over the 
Internet and is managed by the service provider.


Match the provider with the type of service:

TYPE                                                                  PROVIDER
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)                                GoDaddy
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)                          Rackspace, Digital Ocean
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)                                Gmail


Cloud Computing Deployment Model
Public Cloud
A public cloud makes resources available over the Internet to the general public.

Private Cloud / On premises
A private cloud is a proprietary network that supplies services to a limited number of people.

Hybrid Cloud
A hybrid model contains a combination of both a public and a private cloud.


Benefits
There are several benefits to the cloud.
Stop guessing about capacity.
Avoid huge capital investments up front.
Pay for only what you use.
Scale globally in minutes.
Deliver faster.

Latency is d time taken to receive response when a request is sent

Global Infrastructure
Region is considered a geographic location/area on a map.

Availability Zone: is an isolated location in a region 
and is a physical data center within a specific region.

Edge Location: is a mini-data center used solely to cache 
large data files closer to a user's location.

Additional Information
There are more Availability Zones (AZs) than there are Regions.
There should be at least two AZs per Region.
Each region is located in a separate geographic area.
AZs are distinct locations that are engineered to be isolated from failures.

TOPIC                                             DEFINITION/FEATURE
Region                                            Geographical location
Edge Location                                     Cache files
Availability Zone                                 Data center

Deploying applications across multiple regions can help build a robust architecture.
